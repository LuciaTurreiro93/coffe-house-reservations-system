    <h2>About Coffee House</h2>

    <article class="content-row">

        <div class="content-text">
    <p>
        Coffee House was born from a simple idea: creating a place where quality coffee and meaningful moments come together.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inspired by coffee cultures around the world, we carefully select our beans and refine every brewing method to highlight the unique character of each origin. From sourcing to preparation, every detail is treated with intention and respect.
    </p>

    <p>
        More than a coffee shop, Coffee House is a space designed to slow down, connect, and enjoy. Whether you come to work, meet friends, or simply take a break, our environment invites you to feel at home.
    </p>

    <p>
        We believe that great coffee is not only about flavor, but also about the experience that surrounds it: warmth, care, and a genuine passion for what we do.
